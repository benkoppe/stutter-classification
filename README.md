# Stutter Classification

This is a fork of https://github.com/mitul-garg/stutter-classification that I'm trying to implement in a more modular structure.

The original repo's methods are being used as inspiration for this repo.

Due to its size, the sep-28k clips are not included in this repo. To make the models work, all clips must be downloaded to the data/clips/ folder using the sep-28k repository.

21k rows are encoded with mfcc.
